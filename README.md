# ProofBox : Docker-compose platform providing SMT solvers services


<img src="./static/server_arch.svg" alt="picture">

`ez_proofbox` is a docker platform designed as a server intended to provide services for SMT solvers.

The current version is designed as a [Starexec](https://www.starexec.org) clone.

This work was done during my internship at [Ocamlpro](https://ocamlpro.com/)
